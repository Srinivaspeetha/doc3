<p>
As in any game, the success of competitive strategies depends on knowing the rules as well as the other players. Nevertheless, in the real competitive environment, the rules are not always clear and can change very quickly, demanding quick responses and making it increasingly difficult to map the moves of the main players. 
<br>
<br>
Strong monitoring channels must be maintained to follow changes in the competitive environment and to discern new trends. Changes in the environment can result from emerging technologies or changes in society’s behavior, and thus in clients’ demands. They can also be the result of competitors’ moves in the market. 
<br>
<br>
Thus developing a good competitive strategy depends on mapping the environment and constantly monitoring it to be able to capitalize quickly on opportunities or neutralize threats. 
<br>
<br>
The focus of this chapter is on mapping the environment. It will show the main aspects of the model for industry analysis and explain the process of forming strategic groups and pressure maps.
</p>
<h1><b>Industry Analysis</b><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="5"

                <pre></pre>
<p>
Porter (1979) developed a model to analyze the environment based on mapping five competitive forces in order to better understand the rules of the competitive game and to help companies to find a position in the industry with greater clarity. During the 1990s, it was often remarked that environmental analysis had little to contribute given the turbulent state of the new economy, but Porter (2001) was able to demonstrate how important environmental analysis is, especially when there are a large number of uncertainties.
            <br>
A good map is most useful during a storm! 
            <br>
To develop a map of an industry, one needs to know how the main players behave and how the battle for greater profitability works. According to Porter (1979), there are five competitive forces that run through an industry: customers, suppliers, current competitors, new entrants, and substitute products or services. 
            <br>
Understanding these five forces is vital to formulating a company’s competitive strategy. The model for Industry Analysis is shown in Figure 2.1. 
            <br>
The pressures exercised by these forces are structural determinants both of competition and of an industry’s profitability (Porter, 1979). In Figure 2.1, the battle for profitability in the supply chain, i.e., the bargaining power of
        <br>

<p>
customers and suppliers is laid out along the horizontal axis. The relationship among competitors, whether those are already established, potential entrants, or substitute products, is shown along the vertical axis. 
            <br>
It is important to emphasize that industry, in this context, means an industrial sector and not a single company.
            <br>
The structure of an industrial sector depends on how the competitive forces are configured. When they are stronger, there is less potential for profitability. It is easy to imagine that within an industry with fierce competition, the rate of return tends to be less. On the outside limit, an industrial structure with all five forces intensified, approaches the economic model of “perfect competition.”
            <br>
On the other hand, there are industries where the five competitive forces are weak, i.e., the rivalry among existing competitors is not intense, the entry barriers for new competitors are difficult to overcome, and there are no substitute products. Allied to this favorable scenario, the sector is the driver of the supply chain, with high bargaining power with the others tiers in the chains, whether customers or suppliers. This type of industrial sector is called “five star” since it shows a high potential for profitability. 
            <br>
Industry analysis allows us to identify which competitive forces most influence the industrial sector. It is common for one force in the competitive industrial environment to stand out and the competitive strategy should focus on it. It is then possible to influence the competitive environment in such a way as to assume a strategic position that can neutralize it, and thus to obtain a sustainable competition advantage, as seen in Chapter I. 
            <br>
It is worth emphasizing that the map of the sector structure is dynamic, since the industry can undergo changes and, depending on the magnitude of the competitive movement of each player, the shape of the five forces can be altered, having an impact on its attractiveness.</p>
         <br>
<h1><b>Mapping the Competitive Forces in the Supply Chain: Relationships with Customers and Suppliers</b><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="5"/></h1>
        <p>
Bargaining power in the relationship with customers and suppliers has a decisive impact on both an industry’s profitability and attractiveness. Imagine the vehicle assembly plants and their auto parts suppliers seated around the bargaining table. It is east to predict that the scale will tilt toward the side of the assemblers When the customers are concentrated and direct large volumes, such as the case of the assembly plants, they manage to bargain for better prices, increasing demands for quality, flexibility in the product mix and the volume of production, as well as access to information via Integrated Management Systems — ERP. They thus diminish the industry’s freedom to establish its own rules. This situation is aggravated when the products supplied by the industrial sector are standardized, are not critical to the quality of the customers’ production, and can be substituted without generating costs for the change (Carvalho et al., 2003).
            <br>
Table 2.1 shows some aspects, which determine the bargaining power of an industry, tilting the balance when they are present. 
            <br>
When the forces in the supply chain are intense, it is important to outline a strategy for buyers and suppliers, with criteria for choosing buyers and for selecting target customers and also for developing a buying strategy, paying attention to strategic aspects and not just operational ones.
            <br>
This matrix proposed by Cox et al. (2001) is a useful tool for analyzing bargaining power between buyers and suppliers. Figure 2.2 shows the matrix, where the horizontal axis shows the dominance of the supplier and the vertical shows the dominance of the buyer, and four quadrants: buyer dominance, interdependence, independence, and supplier dominance. 
            <br>
The quadrants of buyer dominance and supplier dominance indicate who has power over the other. In the independence quadrant, buyers and suppliers have attributes of power, and both must be involved in order to carry out any agreed upon exchanges. In the independence quadrant, neither of the two have attributes of power, nor are they capable of demanding that the other fulfill their requirements, and both have other opportunities for doing business.

<p>
Yet in the more complex supply chains, a more detailed analysis of the relationship among the links must be done. It is necessary to identify which link commands the chain, i.e., dominates the strategic activities which add value. Two aspects take on special importance in this analysis, as we will see in more detail in Chapter III — governance of the chain and the value system.</p>
<br>
<h1><b>Analyzing the Competitors: Current, Potential and Substitutions</b><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="5"
/></h1>
<p>
Competition in a given industry can be a factor that significantly limits profitability. In an industry with an intense rivalry, this can lead to predatory actions, eroding the attractiveness and profitability of the industry as a whole. 
    <br>
It is important to note that rivalry should not be analyzed just in the context of existing competitors, but also in the extended rivalry which includes new entrants and substitute products and services, as illustrated in Figure 2.3. In industries that are threatened by substitute products or have a high potential for new entrants, competition tends to be sharper and often sets off price wars. 
    <br>
There are many aspects that have an impact on the rivalry among established competitors in an industry and in the battle for market share and better competitive positioning. Imagine, for example, a sector where growth is slow or stagnant! For a company to grow, it has to take market shares from the

<p>
competitors, increasing rivalry among the established competitors, which is not the case when the industry is growing overall. The main points to be verified in analyzing the forces of competition are:                
</p>
<menu>
<li type="disc">Numerous or balanced competitors</li><br>
<li type="disc">Slow growth of the industry</li><br>
<li type="disc">High fixed costs</li><br>
<li type="disc">Absence of differentiation</li><br>
<li type="disc">Increased capacity in large increments</li><br>
<li type="disc">Competitors with divergent strategies</li><br>
<li type="disc">High exit barriers</li><br>
</menu>
<p>
When rivalry is extensive, the threat of new entrants to an industry is strongly related to the effective entry barriers and the expectation of potential competitors regarding retaliation from already established players. 
    <br>
The main source of entry barriers for new competitors is the economies of scales, whether for production, research, marketing, or services, which require that the entrant operate on a large scale or which place the entrant at a cost disadvantage. In addition to this barrier, there are cost disadvantages, which are independent of scale, such as patent costs, access to raw material, location, official subsidies, and learning curves. For a long time, Xerox took advantage                
</p>
                <br>
<center><i>Figure 2.4. Factors affecting the learning curve (adapted from Heizer and Render, 1999)</i></center>
        <br>
                <center>

<p>
of its patent for the copying machine to remain all alone in the market, however, when the patent expired, a lot of entrants such as Canon, Hewlett Packard, and others came on the scene.
    <br>
According to Heizer and Render (1999), learning curve models were first observed for the aeronautics industry. It has been calculated that for the period 1925-1957, the number of worker-hours per unit was reduced by 80%. 
    <br>
Learning curves, when applied to the context of strategy, allow us to determine changes in the volume-cost trade-off, and to evaluate performance for the business and the industry. The major restrictions to these models are related to the wide range of variables, which need to be analyzed, as illustrated in Figure 2.4. 
    <br>
    <i>Other important sources of barriers are:product differentiation, capital requirements, change costand access to distribution channels. </i>
    <br>
The threat of new entrants can also affect expectations regarding retaliation from already established competitors, especially when excess capacity and/or capital are available to maintain and sustain a direct battle. 
    <br>
Finally, the last force of competition to be analyzed is the pressure of substitute products/services. Substitutes can be defined as those which carry out the same function, even with another technology base (another industry). Substitutes, which are subject to price/performance, trade off with products from the industry and/or those produced by five-star industries merit the most attention.

<h1><b>Taking a Look Inside the Industry</b><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="5"

                <br>
<p>
As we saw earlier, even though all the companies within an industry are subject to the same forces of competition, they adopt different strategic positions with different results. Therefore, the analysis of the overall industry can be deepened, extending to a structural analysis within the industry 
    <br>
The steps for doing a structural analysis inside the industry are:

</menu>
<p>
The breadth of different strategies throughout an industry depends on the nature of the industry. The choice of strategy has repercussions in the strategic dimension, which demands trade-offs. According to Porter (1987) the following dimensions can be identified:                
</p>
<br>
<br>
 <h1><b>Strategic Groups</b><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="5"
/></h1>               
                <br>
                <br>
<p>
Strategic groups allow clustering the firms in groups of similar companies, consisting in an analytical tool that makes easier the industry’s analysis. Strategic-groups method assumes that similar firms react similarly in the some external disturbances (Feka et al., 1997). 
    <br>
Strategic groups cluster firms in groups of similar companies, forming an analytical tool that makes it easier to analyze the industry. The strategic-group method assumes that similar firms react in a similar way to external disturbances (Feka et al., 1997). While the company should stake out a singular position, it is possible to identify strategic groups that are following the same or a similar strategy within an industry (see the section titled Dimensions of Competitive Strategy). These strategic groups usually diverge in their approaches to the product or to marketing. Even though there could be cases of a single strategic group in an industry, these are rare.
    <br>
An industry’s historical development explains differences in strategy and the barriers to mobility, which follows the players’ different resources and potentials, as well as their differences in terms of goals and positioning with regard to risk. This leads to the formation of strategic groups within the industry. Yet, changes in the industry’s structure can facilitate the formation of new strategic groups or make the groups homogenous.
    <br>
Strategic groups affect the barriers to mobility, bargaining power up and down the supply chain, the threat of substitutions and rivalry within the industry. Global barriers to entry differ greatly depending on the specific strategic group the newcomer intends to join, as well as creating barriers to changes of position from one strategic group to another. These barriers to mobility end up discouraging changing strategic position. High barriers explain differences in profitability between companies. 
    <br>
Strategic groups can also affect bargaining power in the chain, since they confer different degrees of vulnerability on common buyers and suppliers. Strategic groups permit one to focus on different parts of the product line, to serve different customers, to operate with different levels of quality and technological innovation, and to have different cost positions, minimizing the level of exposure to competition from substitute products. 
    <br>
The presence of several strategic groups almost always affects the level of rivalry inside the industry, since there can be interdependence among the groups in the market or in their degree of overlap in targeting customers. The possibility of product differentiation achieved by the groups, the number and relative size of the strategic groups, strategic distancing between groups, or the degree of divergence of strategy are other factors that have impact on the global rivalry of the industry. 
    <br>
A company’s viability, as a function of its chosen strategic group, is affected by the structural analysis within the industry, as we have seen. Still, other factors affect the profitability of a company or group, such as the position of the company inside its group, the degree of competition within the group, the scale of the company in relation to others in the group, the cost of entry into the group, and the company’s ability to execute and implement its chosen strategy in operational terms.
    <br>
It is worth stressing that it is not always true that a company with a larger market share is more viable. Larger companies will be more viable if they compete in strategic groups more protected by barriers to mobility and with a stronger position in the chain, and the smaller companies will be more viable if there are no large economies of scale and if they adopt differentiated strategies for service and technological innovation. This exception should not be taken as a rule, since that could lead to a commodity trap. The view that cost position is the sole sustainable factor on which a competitive strategy can be built, which can invade the territory of other areas of strategy, is not easily sustainable, an, in global low-cost positioning, is not always necessarily important.

<h1><b>SWOT Analysis and Strategic Groups</b><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="5"
/></h1>
                <br>
The analysis and choice of which strategic groups one should compete in has implications in formulating strategy. Hence, these decisions have to take into consideration the comparison between a company’s strengths and weaknesses, whether they are structural or related to implementing the selected strategy, and they must highlight distinctive competencies in order to maximize opportunities and minimize threats arising from the competitive environment. The SWOT analysis seen in Chapter I, allows us to visualize the impact of strategic groups on strategy in a structured way as illustrated in Table 2.1.
                <br>
                
<h1><b>Strategic Groups Map</b><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="5"

                <br>
<p>
The map of strategic groups presents a graphic demonstration of competition in an industry, identifying the relative position of the diverse adversaries within it. The map of strategic groups is laid out along two axes, which contain the critical dimensions for industry analysis, usually dealt with at two levels, high and low, as illustrated in Figure 2.5. Hence, the first step in mapping is to select the strategic variables that will be used along the axes. In order to do so, one needs to decide which variables determine the most important barriers to mobility for the industry.

Feka et al. (1997) state that total revenue can measure the size of each company, while its business focus can be seen in the percentage of sales in relation to the company’s total revenue. The market share of the analyzed company’s product in relation to its competitors determines its market positioning. However, it is important to stress that other measurements could be used to represent better the competitive environment in a specific industry.                
</p>
<h1><b>Competitive Pressure Diagram</b><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="5"
/></h1>             
                <br>
<p>Another instrument to map the competitive environment is the competitive pressure diagram (D’Aveni, 2002). According to this author: “The more two firms’ products or geographic markets overlap, the more pressure they exert on each other. The pressure is proportional to the importance of markets to each firm and their degree of penetration. This simple concept enables organizations to quantify the degree of pressure that one rival puts on another.” As D’Aveni writes, pressure systems can never be frozen; the best that can be achieved is a kind of ‘dynamic stability’.
    <br>
D’Aveni (2002) states that the competitive pressure from a given incursion into a rival’s geographical or product market can be measured by two factors: the importance of the market (I.M.) and the size of the incursion (S.I.). This pressure is given by the formula:
    <br>
    Competitive Pressure = I.M.·S.I.                     <p align="right">(1)<br></p>
    <br>
    <br>
<p align="left">Where:
    <br></p>
    <br>
<menu>
 <li type="disc"><b>I.M.:</b> The percentage of the targeted firm’s total revenue represented by the market;</li><br>
<li type="disc"><b>S.I.:</b> The market share achieved by the invading firm.Similarly, to the strategic groups, the pressures map is valid just for a short period. In this diagram, each circle represents one of the market players and arrows represent the pressure each player is exercising on the others. The diameters of the companies’ representative circles mean the size of the respective market share at that moment. The width of the arrows in the diagram indicates the intensity of the pressures.
    <br>
These pressure maps can be also useful to take decisions about, offensive or defensive moves, in conjunction with other decision-making tools like the rivalry matrix, decision trees, and Game Theory. However, Furrer and Thomas (2000) warn that the analyzed market should have few decision variables and a predictable environment.
    <br>
In both kinds of competitive environment maps, data about the market should be obtained from secondary sources in order to construct these diagrams.</li>

<h1><b>Internal Analysis of the Company to Adequate Positioning</b><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="5"/></h1>
<p>
Identifying the competencies a company needs in order to gain competitive advantage in a market which is in constant mutation is an arduous task. However, the capacity for knowing its potential and developing it in a consistent way can be decisive for a successful positioning on the competitive scene. <br>As we saw in Chapter I, self-knowledge propounded by Sun Tzu and other philosophers is a decisive weapon in the competitive game
    <br>
The focus of this chapter is to discuss how a company should position its competitive strategy in order to maximize its competencies, but without losing sight of the competitive state of the industry overall.
</p>
                
<h1><b>Core Competencies</b><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="5"/></h1>
                <br>
<p>
The word competence comes from the Latin,<i>competere</i>. The derivation of the concept of competencies can be seen by taking apart the Latin word:<i>com</i>, which means<i>together</i> andpetere, which means<i>effort</i>. Identifying the set of forces that will be able to lead the organization to build a sustainable competitive advantage is vital in the context of strategy. (Rabechini Jr. & Carvalho, 2003).  
    <br>
Prahalad and Hamel (1990) relate the competitive success of a corporation to its ability to identify, cultivate, and exploit its core competencies. 
    <br>
For these authors, competitiveness in the long-run derives from the ability to build core competencies more rapidly and at a lower cost than the competition. To build them, it is necessary to meld a broad range of abilities in production and technology with competencies the enable individual deals and adapt rapidly to new opportunities, generating competitive advantage for the corporation.
    <br>
In cultivating core competencies, the corporation manages to share costs, without needing to invest more than the competition in research and development.
    <br>
Figure 2.6 represents the diversified corporation as a large tree. The trunk and larger branches are the core products, the smaller branches are the business units; the leaves, flowers, and fruits are the final product. The roots are core competencies, whose function is to distribute nutrients and provide stability to the tree.
    <br>
Each part of the tree determines a different plane of competition: core competencies, core products, and final products. The battles for market partners are engaged at each of these levels, and leadership in final products does not imply leadership at the other levels. Being given a dominant position in relation to core products allows a company to mold the evolution of application and finals markets and managing to achieve economies of scale and of scope, since the market share of core products can come from multiple industries.
                </p><br>

    </center><br>
<p>
Core products incorporate one or more core competencies, making the link between core competencies and final products. These products are the key components of various final products and contribute to generating value in the final product, materializing core competencies. According to Prahalad and Hamel (1990), Matsushita holds 45% of the market in the manufacturing of key components for VCRs (core product), while its brands participation in the final product (Panasonic, JVC) represents 20% of the market. Another of Matsushita’s core products is the compressor, with 40% of the world market, while its participation in air conditioners and refrigerators is quite small.   
    <br>
The concept of core competencies is decisive both for services and manufacturing. In contrast to final products that are consumed upon use, core competencies are enhanced when applied or shared, even though if they are not well-constructed, they can be lost since knowledge also deteriorates.
    <br>
Core competencies require a commitment to working on organizational frontiers, involving different business units, several levels of hierarchy and different functions. Consequently, the traditional concept of a corporation unnecessarily limits individuals’ abilities by making functional cut-offs that patchwork the corporation into autonomous business units, makes core competencies more difficult to achieve.

                <h1><i>Identifying Core Competencies</i><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="1"

<br>
<br>
According to Prahalad and Hamel (1990), it is hard to build world leadership when based in more than five or six core competencies. Consequently, if a corporation has not yet managed to achieve a lean list of competencies, it can apply at least three tests to identify them, as follows:
                <br>
                <br>
<menu>
 <li type="disc"><b>First test:</b> Provides access to a broad variety of markets;</li><br>
<li type="disc"><b>Second test:</b> Makes a significant contribution to the benefits perceived by consumers in the final product;</li>
<li type="disc"><b>Third test:</b> It is hard for competitors to imitate.</li>
</menu>
    <br>
    <br>
<p>
To aid in this process, it is interesting to have recourse to the idea of the tree, extending the concept of core competencies to core products, and finally, to end products. To make this extension in a consistent way, it is suggested that the company reflect on the following questions:
                </p>
<li type="disc">How long can competitiveness in business survive if the core competencies are not controlled?</li>
<li type="disc">How central are these core competencies, in terms of generating value for the client?</li>
<li type="disc">What future opportunities will be lost if these particular competencies are lost?</li>
                <br>
                <br>
<p>
It is important to keep in mind that the complex harmonization of individual technologies and abilities needed to build core competencies cannot be simply acquired by a competitor. It might even acquire some of the technology, but would not be able to duplicate the pattern of internal coordination and learning. 
    <br>
Another important component for self-knowledge is to identify which generic strategies will permit a more adequate positioning in order to construct sustainable competitive advantages.

<h1><b>Generic Competitive Strategies and Positioning</b><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="5"

                <br>
                <br>
<p>
As Porter (1979) suggests, the development of any company in a given industry can be broken down into two parts, the first deriving from the average performance of all its competitors, and the second to the company’s performance relative to the sector. 
    <br>
The issue to be discussed in this chapter is the company’s positioning in order to obtain sustainable competitive advantage. This advantage should guarantee the company greater income that the average of the sector where it is active. According to Porter (1979), there are two basic kinds of competitive advantage: leadership in cost or differentiation. Besides, the scope of strategic action should be defined. The target can be a broader market as a target, with several or restricted, acting only in a specific segment. 
    <br>
Based in these two dimensions, there are four possible generic strategies, as illustrated in the quadrants of Figure 2.7. The generic strategies are: leadership in cost, differentiation, focus on cost, and focus on differentiation. 
    <br>
Defining a generic competitive strategy aims at establishing a favorable, profitable, and sustainable competitive position, against the forces that comprise the competition in an industry. Not doing clear positioning in one of these strategies can result in inferior performance, with a high risk that the company

                <br>
<p>
has an average performance because of the different trade-off of these two kinds of strategies. 
    <br>
In addition, the company disposes itself to deliver two distinct types of value packages for the client (cost and differentiation) or to oscillate between them over time, and this can confuse its image to customers and cause it to lose credibility and its reputation. 
    <br>
The alignment of all an organization’s activities around a generic strategy makes its implementation easier, as well as its communication with customers, employees, and stockholders. Finally, when the strategic positioning is not clear and the trade-offs are not made explicit, it is hard to build the needed resources, creating problems with internal coordination Porter (1996). In this manner, the most critical position in terms of strategic positioning is the central region, as highlighted in Figure 2.7. 
    <br>
Nonetheless Deschamps and Nayak (1995) warn that this or-or type proposition can lead to errors of interpretation called the Commodity Trap. The Commodity Trap comes from an error of interpretation that associates strategies of differentiation to small, specialized companies active in segments or niches of the market, leaving it to the large companies to adopt strategies of low cost. 
    <br>
Before defining the generic strategy, it is important to verify the positioning of the competitors, by making a detailed structural analysis inside the industry,highlighting the major strategic groups and their dimensions. Remember that the essence of good strategic positioning is selecting activities that distinguish the company from its competitors.
    <br>
We stress that, in principle, the strategy of cost leadership is not intrinsically better than that of differentiation or vice versa. Everything depends on the external context and the unique conditions of each company!               
</p>
<h1><i>Cost Leadership</i><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="1"
/></h1>
                <br>
<p>
The company that seeks leadership in cost has to focus the entire organization to achieve this objective, creating a culture of low costs, working constantly to reduce waste and remaining constantly attentive to the cost positions of its competitors.
                <br>
In order to obtain this advantage, the company needs to make trade-offs, such as letting go of greater variety and flexibility in favor of lower costs. On the other hand, this does not mean that the company that adopts this strategy will have poor-quality products. 
    <br>
The corporation that competes in this strategy has to create a gap in cost performance in relation to other competitors in the industry, which allows it to increase margins of profit, as illustrated in Figure 2.8. If the company manages to establish a level for costs which is much lower than the competition, but at the same time sets off a price war, this will reduce the margins and consequently its profitability. The goal is to work with costs well below average for the industry but to set prices only slightly lower than the competition.
</p>
                <br>

Companies such as the airline GOL, are always searching in different areas, involving quick in flight service, that doesn’t require preparation and facilitates the later cleaning of the airplane, quick boarding and debarking procedures, making equipment available more rapidly for new flights, as well as investing in technology and maintenance focused on operational efficiency. 
                <br>
The bases for competition in this strategy are shaken up when competitors are able to quickly overcome the gap, eroding the bases for cost leadership, or when technology changes, eliminating advantages of scale, for example.
                </p>

<h1><i>Differentiation</i><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="1"
/></h1>         
                <br>
                <br>
<p>
The rationale for a generic strategy of differentiation is also to increase the company margin starting from the price variable, not the cost variable 
    <br>
The goal of the companies that compete for differentiation is to identify and satisfy customers’ needs, but those needs for which the client is inclined to pay a premium price. Therefore, the greater viability obtained in this business profile derives form the price premium. This does not mean, however, that companies that compete with this generic strategy can disregard the price variable. Once the target for differentiation has been defined, only costs associated to differentiation can be absorbed. In other aspects, the company should also exercise careful daily cost management, if it doesn’t, it will be eliminating the margin obtained from the premium price with excessive costs as illustrated in Figure 2.9. 
    <br>
Companies such as the Brazilian airline TAM seek out added value by offering differentiated services to the client which allows it to charge more, and it clearly communicates the difference to the client — “TAM’s way of flying”. To add</p>
                <br>

    </center><br>
<p>value, it offers a more customized service in the air as well as on land. In opting for this approach, the trade-offs with the lower-cost positioning are explicit. 
    <br>
Results of competitive advantage in differentiation usually lead to investments in innovation and technology, always with the focus on the specific needs of the customers which add value, as well as the use of more specialized labor who in counterpart obtain higher remuneration. 
    <br>
The bases for competition in this strategy are shaken when the competitors are able to quickly manage to imitate the target of differentiation offering very similar packages of value or the differentiated object loses importance due to changes in the environment. For this reason, these companies have to be always in motion, improving performance and innovating more rapidly than their competitors. 
    <br>
This strategy implies higher risks, since the target of differentiation chosen by the company will not be able to obtain a premium price. In this case, the company will have costs higher than the industry average, without being able to charge more for its extra costs, since customers don’t see value in the package offered. This happened with several retail companies that decided to differentiate their products through selling on the Internet, but didn’t manage to add value, since the average consumer hasn’t even got a computer, and they suffered losses with B2C (business-to-consumer).</p>
                <br>
            <br>
<h1><i>Focus</i><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="1"
/></h1>
                <br>
<p>
The generic strategy of focus, on cost as well as differentiation, has many things in common with the strategies of cost leadership and differentiation, respectively. Basically, they differ in competitive scope.
    <br>
The key to this strategy is to find the lucrative, sustainable target segment to exercise the strategy, whether of cost or differentiation. This focus on a segment allows the company to develop performance superior to its competitors, who have multiple targets. This segmentation can be a function of a geographic cut, or of scale, or an activity that reaches a specific type of consumer. 
    <br>
Once the target segment has been selected, the company has to devote all its efforts consistently in this direction, clearly communicating its option to the market. To have greater success in selecting the segment to implement the strategy of focus, segments that are more needy than others must be prioritized. As with the strategy of differentiation, here the risks are also high since in addition to the specific trade-offs of strategy of cost or differentiation, there are trade-offs related to the target segment, for example, abandoning distribution channels. In case the trade-offs made do not result in value for the customers, these choices end up generating performance inferior to the industry average. 
    <br>
Defining generic strategy has a decisive impact on manufacturing strategy and the definition of competitive criteria that orient it, as we will see shortly.</p>

Auto assembly plants engaged in much more respectful competition in the past than now. Partnerships such as Autolatina in Brazil, shared between Volkswagen and Ford, from 1987 to 1995, were viable in the closed market, but ceased to be so with the opening of commerce. The number of competitors with plants in the country multiplied, from those already installed before the opening, GM, Fiat, and Toyota, to those of the French – Renault, Peugeot, and Citroën; and the Japanese with Honda. Presently the majority of models produced in Brazil are of European origin. 
    <br>
To aggravate the situation, the automotive industry began to experience slow growth during that period, which led to even sharper competition. 
    <br>
The assemblers depended more on the supply of components produced and supplied by the first tier suppliers, with higher added value, which related to second and third level tiers in the supply chain, who manufactured sub-sets and individual components.

</b><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="5"

<p>
The absence of large Brazilian retail chains in the city of Belém, in the Amazon State, is due to difficulties in meeting the specifics of the local market and the complexity of supplying it
    <br>
In the 1980s, the Pão de Açúcar Group, the largest supermarket chain in Brazil, was the largest major supermarket chain present in Belém, but ended up beating a retreat during the group’s restructuring. The Bom-Preço channel also gave up fighting over Belem´s consumers, closing 10 stores in 1993. 
    <br>
Local groups were very aggressive in defending their territory, balancing modernizing of their stores with their regional roots. Peculiarities of local demand are very marked. Regional customs make the residents of Belem very particular consumers of things such as vegetables typical of the region, such as jambu, bacuri, cupuaçu, teperebá, or uxi, and the substitution of fresh milk with powdered milk. Imagine the effort needed to supply customized products for department stores or supermarkets in this city! 
    <br>
Due to their good knowledge of the characteristics of the local market, the local retail groups, such as Yamada, Leader, and Visão have managed to hold their own. Among the major retail chains in the country, only C&A, Arapuã, Riachuelo, and Lojas Americanas dispute the local market.

<h1><b>Case-Bologna Competitive Market</b><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="5"

                <br>
<p>
The bologna market in metropolitan São Paulo, Brazil, is highly competitive. The main players are six high competitive companies with strong local brands: Cardeal, Ceratti, Marba, Rezende, Sadia, and Perdigão. 
    <br>
Two pressure maps were drawn and each diagram is a picture of the São Paulo’s bologna market for each period analyzed. For the studied industry, it was assumed that the importance of the market (I.M.) was the percentage of bologna in the company’s total revenue and the size of the incursion (S.I.) was the market share achieved reached by each analyzed player.
    <br>
The strongest pressure ordinarily gets the quickest or the most effective response. Figure 2.10 shows a competitive pressures map, which represents the beginning of a great offensive movement of Ceratti over its stronger competitor, Marba, with significant reflexes on the others. It seems that Marba did not make any effort to avoid the imminent aggression from Ceratti.

Figure 2.11 shows a significant expressive retaliation by Marba over Ceratti for the purpose of recovering its market share. Cardeal also made sales efforts to gain market shares from Ceratti, Sadia, and Perdigão. Apparently, Perdigão

<h1><b>Case – Building Competencies at NEC</b><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="5"
/></h1>
                <br>
<p>
At the end of the 1980s, NEC emerged as a leader in the area of semiconductors and as one of the major competitors in producing telecommunications and computers. In addition to consolidating its position in mainframes for computers and acting in the areas of public commuters and transmitters, it began to produce products for everyday use such as cell phones, faxes, laptops — linking telecommunications and office automation.
    <br>
NEC is the only company among the five major revenues in telecommunications, semiconductors, and mainframes industries. 
    <br>
In the beginning of the 1970s, NEC articulated a strategy to explore the convergence of computers with communications, which was called “C&C.” The success of this management strategy resulted in the acquisition of competencies, especially in semiconductors. NEC formed the “C&C Committee” composed of high-level executives to supervise the development of its core products and core competencies alongside its individual business interests. In accordance with its strategic structure, NEC transferred enormous resources to fortify its position in components and central processors. By employing collaborative arrangements to multiply its internal resources, NEC was ready to accumulate a vast range of core competencies. NEC carefully identified three channels for technological evolution and interrelated markets, involving things from its large mainframes to distribution processes, components from simple ICs to VSLI, and communications from mechanical exchange bars to complex digital systems that we now call ISDN. Finally, NEC determined that semiconductors would be its most important product. 
    <br>
To build up its competencies rapidly and at low cost, NEC got involved in numerous numbers of strategic alliances, which numbered over 100 just in 1987. In mainframes, the best-known alliance was with Honeywell and Bull. Almost all the arrangements in the area of semiconductors and components were oriented toward access to technology. The research director at NEC summed up this acquisition of competencies during the 1970s and 1980s thusly, “From the point of view of investment, it was much cheaper and quicker to use outside technology. There was no need for us to develop new ideas.”

<h1><b>Case – In Search of a Generic Strategy at Bunge</b><hr width="100%" color="#050400" size="5"
/></h1>
                <br>
<p>
The Bunge group, the third largest processor of soy in the world, with billing of 10 billion dollars per year, is active in Brazil, Argentina, and the United States.     
    <br>
Brazil is responsible for about half of world sales, and it is only here that the group has a consumer goods division, Santista Foods, with 20 factories and over 100 brand names that range from breads to margarines.
    <br>
About three years ago, the Bunge stockholders resolved to focus on the agricultural commodities market to compete with the Americans, Cargill and ADM, the two largest corporations in the sector. Based on this decision, several business units were sold, but Santista, which had been put up for sale in 1998, remained. According to a former Santista executive: “the consumer area always represents the least part of Bunge’s billing and 90% of its headaches,” constituting a kind of foreign body in the Bunge organism, since the integration of this company into the global strategy has required major efforts by its executives. 
    <br>
Santista has been devalued by about 10 million dollars since its acquisition by the Bunge group, with significant liquid losses in 2000, causing Bunge’s entire Brazil operation to close in the red. 
    <br>
The total profit on other operations — pulled by the fertilizer area — was about 60 million dollars “Despite the slips in the consumer areas, the group has been very successful with its strategy in the area of commodities and fertilizers,” says Luciana Massaad, investment analyst for the Itaú Bank. 
    <br>
The solution to problems caused by maintaining a division foreign to Bunge’s focus has to do with the challenge of valorizing Santista Foods and Sears, separating out the businesses that are of interest to the group, integrating them into the global strategy, and selling off the rest, preferably for a good price. 
    <br>
Many of Bunge’s difficulties with the consumer area come from the group’s traditional vocation in the area of agricultural commodities. This has been the group’s area of competency since 1818, when it founded the Koninklijke Bunge in Amsterdam to import grain from the Dutch colonies. Looking for wheat, Bunge arrived in Argentina in 1874. In 1906 it landed in Brazil, acquiring Moinho Santista. During periods of prosperity for wheat, the food group began to develop around these mills, which became accustomed to large volume business. The executives trained at Bunge were never close to the consumer market as were the teams from companies such as Unilever, one of the principals of Santista Alimentos in the area of margarine and mayonnaise. Until a short while ago, sales personnel spoke of tons of bread sold and not in units, as this is normally referred to in other consumer goods companies. “We will never be like a Unilever or Nestlé in terms of brand name management,” says Weisser. 
    <br>
The strategy of the team led by Weisser, at least up until now, has been to eliminate the less profitable brands from Santista Alimentos. Some products have also bee redirected to large institutional clients, such as bakeries. “Publicity efforts are not needed in order to serve this market,” says analyst/ Luciana, from Itaú. “What is important is volume. And Bunge understands volume.” 
    <br>
The idea is to integrate Santista more and more into Bunge Foods, Bunge’s Food Company in the United States, which does not have consumer brand names and is totally dedicated to the sales segment for bakeries, industries and to the area of its own brand names in supermarket chains. The group is seeking to create synergy between the two operations. Source: Adapted from Mano (2001).</p>
